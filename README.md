# AutoHotkey Virtual Desktop Kit

A two-part utility for mastering Windows virtual desktops with AutoHotkey v2.

---

## ðŸ”§ What's Included

### 1. `Windows Desktop Hotkeys.ahk`

Provides powerful hotkeys for manual control of virtual desktops:

- `Win + 1..0`: Switch to desktop 1â€“10
- `Win + Shift + 1..0`: Move the active window to desktop 1â€“10
- Automatically creates missing desktops as needed
- Powered by `VirtualDesktopAccessor.dll`
- Unpin all items from the taskbar to stop windows using the same keys

### 2. `App to Desktop Mapper.ahk`

Automatically moves specific apps to predefined desktops:

- Detects windows based on `exe` and optional window title regex
- Configurable via `desktop-rules.json`
- Runs quietly in the background and polls every 250ms
- Includes live reload (`Ctrl + Alt + R`)
- Dynamically re-applies rules when windows reopen

## ðŸ§  Configuration

Edit `desktop-rules.json` to control automatic window assignment:

[
{ "exe": "brave.exe", "title": "^Titan", "desktop": 4 },
{ "exe": "brave.exe", "desktop": 1 },
{ "exe": "explorer.exe", "desktop": 2 },
{ "exe": "code.exe", "desktop": 3 },
{ "exe": "discord.exe", "desktop": 5 }
]

- `exe`: Required. The process name (case-insensitive)
- `title`: Optional. A regular expression to match the window title
- `desktop`: Required. The virtual desktop number (1-based)

ðŸ’¡ First matching rule wins â€” later entries are ignored if matched earlier.
